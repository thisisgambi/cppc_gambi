# C++ Practical Course - s18


## Session 1:

- Basics


## Session 2:



What happens if the compiler sees the following expression ?:

```lang=c
const int x = 123;
const int y = 345;

int var = x + y;
```



Abstraction always causes overhead:
- Yes! But when?
  - Runtime vs compile time

const int * cip;
int * const ipc;


### Read-only pointer to int

const int * const

### Remember:

- read from right to left for manual, mental type deduction
- Rule of Three
- operators are the same as methods
  - function: can be called several times and it will not change any of the parameters
  - method: may change the parameters (??)
- think in concepts; Classes are user-defined types that hold against certain concepts in the form of a program;
